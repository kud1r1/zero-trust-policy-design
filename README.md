# Zero Trust Policy Design for Securing Remote and Hybrid Workforces

## 📌 Overview  
This project presents a structured Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) policy framework designed to secure modern **remote and hybrid workforces**. With organisations increasingly shifting away from traditional office-centric models, legacy perimeter-based security approaches are no longer sufficient. This repository consolidates research, policy design, architecture diagrams, and actionable security controls that enable a secure, scalable, and identity-centric Zero Trust model.

## 🧩 Abstract  
The increasing reliance on hybrid and remote work models has introduced complex challenges for traditional cybersecurity approaches, which often depend on perimeter-based security measures. This research explores the development of a Zero Trust policy aimed at strengthening security within remote and hybrid work environments.

Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), centred on the principle **“never trust, always verify,”** provides a modern framework focused on strict identity verification, continuous monitoring, and least-privilege access. This project analyses Zero Trust principles and their application in securing dispersed workforces. It examines key components including:

- Identity and Access Management (IAM)  
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)  
- network segmentation  
- Endpoint Security  
- Continuous Monitoring  
- Role of AI/ML in threat detection  

The study also explores policy adaptations for remote work, privacy and compliance requirements, and implementation challenges. By integrating literature review, case studies, and policy design, this research delivers a practical and organised Zero Trust framework. The resulting policies aim to support organisations in enhancing their cybersecurity posture while balancing security and usability for a secure and productive remote workforce.
